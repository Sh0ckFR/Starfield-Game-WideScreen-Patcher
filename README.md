# How to use it

- Close your game.

This tool is malwares free, no viruses etc... but if you don't trust me, you can clone the project and recompile it with Visual Studio.

This is the only official repository, so do not download this tool from another link, I'm not responsible if you download an infected version on YouTube or other.
