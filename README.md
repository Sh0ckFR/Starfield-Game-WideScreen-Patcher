# Starfield-Game-WideScreen-Patcher
Starfield WideScreen 32/9 Patcher is a tool to patch the Starfield binary to disable the black bars on a 32/9 WideScreen on the Steam version only (I will try to update it for the GamePass version later).

# How to use it

- Close your game.
- Unzip and Patch Starfield.exe with this tool.
- Start your game, the main menu will have the black bars visible but no more visible during the game.

This tool is malwares free, no viruses etc... but if you don't trust me, you can clone the project and recompile it with Visual Studio.

This is the only official repository, so do not download this tool from another link, I'm not responsible if you download an infected version on YouTube or other.
